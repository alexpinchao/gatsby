> I am going to tell the little story of how I got interested in programming.

I belong to the generation of 95, I had the great joy of starting video games with the ps2 and I really enjoyed their games, then I got to know the xbox with games that marked my childhood and adolescence a lot, but when I grew up I was curious to know who created these games?, how were they created?, what made the characters move?; Due to these doubts I wanted to begin to understand how these things worked and that is why I dedicated myself to programming. The last thing I have to say is that I like to play sports and I love programming. The only bad thing about this is that I can't do it on a bicycle, although I can do it from the beach so that's great.
